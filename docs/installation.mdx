FileKit is a Kotlin Multiplatform library for file operations. It provides a platform-agnostic file API and UI components for file operations.

## Supported Platforms

FileKit supports the following targets:
- Android
- iOS, macOS
- JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- JS, WASM

## FileKit Core

FileKit Core provides the fundamental file operations with the `PlatformFile` abstraction. It allows you to work with files in a platform-agnostic way. You can create, read, write, and delete files using the `PlatformFile` API.

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core:0.10.0-beta01")
```

```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions]
filekit = "0.10.0-beta01"

[libraries]
filekit-core = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core", version.ref = "filekit" }
```

</CodeGroup>

Once installed, you'll need to perform [platform-specific setup](/core/setup) for some targets.


## FileKit Dialogs

FileKit Dialogs helps you display file-related dialogs to users like file pickers, directory pickers, photo pickers, save dialogs, camera access, and more. FileKit Dialogs comes in two flavors:

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
// Enables FileKit dialogs without Compose dependencies
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs:0.10.0-beta01")

// Enables FileKit dialogs with Composable utilities
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs-compose:0.10.0-beta01")
```

```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions]
filekit = "0.10.0-beta01"

[libraries]
filekit-dialogs = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs", version.ref = "filekit" }
filekit-dialogs-compose = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-dialogs-compose", version.ref = "filekit" }
```

</CodeGroup>

FileKit Dialogs automatically integrates with FileKit Core and provides `PlatformFile` support. For platform-specific setup instructions, see the [Dialogs Setup Guide](/dialogs/setup).

## FileKit Coil Integration

FileKit provides a Coil extension to load images from a `PlatformFile` object. This makes it easy to display images from files in your Compose UI.

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-coil:0.10.0-beta01")
```

```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions]
filekit = "0.10.0-beta01"

[libraries]
filekit-coil = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-coil", version.ref = "filekit" }
```

</CodeGroup>

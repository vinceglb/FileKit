FileKit provides a platform-agnostic file abstraction called `PlatformFile`. It allows you to work with files in a platform-agnostic way. You can create, read, write, and delete files using the `PlatformFile` API.

You can use `PlatformFile` in your project by adding the following dependency:

<CodeGroup>

```kotlin build.gradle.kts
implementation("io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core:0.10.0-beta03")
```

```toml libs.versions.toml
[versions]
filekit = "0.10.0-beta03"

[libraries]
filekit-core = { module = "io.github.vinceglb:filekit-core", version.ref = "filekit" }
```

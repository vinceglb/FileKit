FileKit is a lightweight yet powerful library that simplifies file operations across multiple platforms using Kotlin Multiplatform. 

Whether you need to pick files, save documents, access photos, or manage directories, FileKit provides a consistent API that works seamlessly on Android, iOS, macOS, JVM (Windows, macOS, Linux), JS, and WASM.

```kotlin
// Pick an image file
val imageFile = FileKit.openFilePicker(type = FileKitType.Image)

// Pick multiple files
val files = FileKit.openFilePicker(mode = FileKitMode.Multiple())

// Pick a directory
val directory = FileKit.openDirectoryPicker()

// Save a file
PlatformFile(directory, "image.png").write(imageFile)
```
